# 02-Challenge
personal portfolio
This project contains my personal portfolio which will continue to be updated as the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp progresses. 
In it's current state, my portfolio definitely needs work. Creating code from scratch was much harder than anticipated and I did not allow myself enough time to complete the project fully, but I intend to revisit soon.
